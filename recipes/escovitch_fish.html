                <li>In large skillet heat oil over medium heat, until hot, add the fish, cook each side- for about 5-7 minutes until cooked through and crispy on both sides. Remove fish and set aside. Drain oil and leave about 2-3 tablespoons of oil</li>
                <li>Add, bay leave, garlic and ginger, stir-fry for about a minute making sure the garlic does not burn</li>
                <li>Then add onion, bell peppers, carrots, thyme, scotch bonnet, sugar, Worcestershire sauce, all spice-continue stirring for about 2-3 minutes. Add vinegar, mix an adjust salt and pepper according to preference. Let it simmer for about 2 more minutes.</li>
                <li>Discard bay leave, thyme spring and serve over fish with a side of this bammy. You may make the sauce about 2 days in advance.</li>
